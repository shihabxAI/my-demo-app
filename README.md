# My Demo App

This is my **first demo project** on GitHub.  
I am learning how to use **GitHub repositories, commits, and releases**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Versions

- **v1.0**  
  - Initial release with a simple `hello.txt` file.  
  - Message: "Hello World - Version 1.0"

- **v1.1**  
  - Updated the `hello.txt` file with a new line.  
  - Message: "Hello World - Version 1.1 (with update)"

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Add more files and practice version control.  
- Try creating **v1.2** with new updates.  
- Write clear commit messages so changes are easy to track.

## ðŸ’¡ About
This repository is only for **practice**.  
It helps me understand how to:
- Create a repo  
- Upload files  
- Make commits  
- Create releases (v1.0, v1.1, â€¦)
